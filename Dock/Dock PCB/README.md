# Dock
The dock uses a "treedix" USB C breakout board instead of a custom PCB for the USB C, as I am not planning to make a large enough volume to justify having a separate b oard with USB C.

The dock is made of several individual PCB's so that they can be slanted in the dock, making it better for mounting on wall (even though really they'd be fine, it looks nicer like that)

Design is not final. I might abandon the slant idea if it's not worth it.
